## **Overview**  

The **Efficient File Management System in C** is a high-performance, CLI-based file manager designed for **Unix/Linux environments**. It leverages **low-level system calls**, **multi-threading**, and **memory-mapped I/O** for **fast and efficient file operations**. The system also includes **encryption, compression, and decompression** capabilities to enhance security and storage efficiency. A Bash-integrated CLI tool is provided for seamless automation and ease of use.

## **Features**  

âœ… **Comprehensive File Operations**: Create, delete, read, write, copy, and move files efficiently.  
âœ… **Multi-Threaded Processing**: Enhances performance and responsiveness.  
âœ… **Advanced Security**: AES-based encryption/decryption for file protection.  
âœ… **Compression & Decompression**: Supports efficient RLE compression.  
âœ… **Optimized for Unix/Linux**: Utilizes POSIX APIs and system calls.  
âœ… **Bash Integration**: Automates command-line file management.

## **Getting Started**  

### **Prerequisites**  
- **C Compiler** (e.g., `gcc`)  
- **Bash Shell** (for script execution)  

### **Installation**  
1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/duanepm/File-Management-System-in-C.git
   ```  
2. **Compile the C program**:  
   ```bash
   gcc -o file_manager file_manager.c -pthread
   ```  
3. **Ensure the Bash script is executable**:  
   ```bash
   chmod +x run.sh
   ```  

---

## **Usage**  

Run the file management system:  
```bash
./run.sh
```

### **Commands**  

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `list` | Lists all files in the directory |
| `create <filename>` | Creates a new file |
| `delete <filename>` | Deletes a file |
| `read <filename>` | Displays file content |
| `write <filename> <content>` | Writes content to a file |
| `encrypt <filename> <password>` | Encrypts a file using AES-based encryption |
| `decrypt <filename> <password>` | Decrypts an encrypted file |
| `copy <source> <destination>` | Copies a file to a new location |
| `move <source> <destination>` | Moves a file |
| `compress <filename>` | Compresses a file using RLE |
| `decompress <filename>` | Decompresses a file |
| `showsize <filename>` | Displays file size |

---

## **Encryption & Security**  
This system uses **AES-based encryption** for securing files, ensuring that sensitive data remains protected.  

---

## **Compression & Decompression**  
Utilizes **Run-Length Encoding (RLE)** to optimize file storage. Best suited for files with repetitive data.  

---

## **Directory Structure**  
- `file_manager.c` - Main C program  
- `run.sh` - Bash script for CLI interaction  
- `README.md` - Documentation
